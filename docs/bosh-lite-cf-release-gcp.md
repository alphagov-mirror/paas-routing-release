# Deploying cf-release on BOSH-lite on GCP

The following instructions provided detailed steps to deploy a [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) deployment with TCP routing and optional advanced steps to enable Isolation Segments. These instructions particularly were created to use a BOSH-lite on Google Cloud Platform.

**Note**: The below instructions use bosh v2 cli.

## Overview of Steps Required

1. [Setup GCP Environment for BOSH-lite director](#setup-gcp-environment-for-bosh-lite-director)
1. [Setup GCP Environment for deployments](#setup-gcp-environment-for-deployments)
1. [Prepare stubs for cf-release](#prepare-stubs-for-cf-release)
1. [Generate deployment manifests and deploy](#generate-deployment-manifests-and-deploy)
1. *Optional*: [Routing Isolation Segments](#routing-isolation-segments)

## Instructions
### Setup GCP Environment for BOSH-lite director
1. Run the following commands to generate the `service-account.key.json`
```
export ACCOUNT_NAME="YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME"
export PROJECT_ID="GCP_PROJECT_ID"
$ gcloud auth login
$ gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create ${ACCOUNT_NAME}
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "service-account.key.json" --iam-account "${ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member "serviceAccount:${ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role 'roles/editor'
```
1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in this documentation to pave a GCP project and deploy the BOSH-lite director: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/bosh-lite-on-gcp-deployment-guide.md
1. Set up DNS to point to the nameservers of the new DNS zone created by Terraform using the `shared-dns` account on AWS.

### Setup GCP Environment for deployments
1. Generate certificates:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes
```

```
---
jobs:
- name: router_z2
  instances: 1
  properties:
    router:
      isolation_segments: [is1]
      routing_table_sharding_mode: segments
- name: ha_proxy_z1
  instances: 0
```

#### Generate deployment manifests, make manual changes, and deploy

##### cf-release
1. Run `CF_RELASE_DIR/scripts/generate_deployment_manifest bosh-lite STUBS_DIR/* > cf.yml`
1. In `cf.yml`:
	- update `router_z1` properties to `router.routing_stable_sharding_mode: shared-and-segments`
	- update `properties.cc.diego.temporary_local_apps: true`
1. `bosh -e PROJECT_NAME -d cf-warden deploy cf.yml`

##### diego-release
1. Update `diego.yml` to include IS by editing the `cell_z2` instance group:
```
  name: cell_z2
  properties:
    diego:
      rep:
        placement_tags: [is1]
```
2. `bosh -e PROJECT_NAME -d cf-warden-diego deploy diego.yml`

##### Validate Isolation Segment
```
# create org, space, iso-seg, and enable appropriately
cf create-org isolated
cf target -o isolated
cf create-space iso-space
cf target -o "isolated" -s "iso-space"
cf create-isolation-segment is1
cf enable-org-isolation isolated is1
cf set-space-isolation-segment iso-space is1

# create domain for is1
cf create-domain isolated is1.PROJECT_NAME.cf-app.com

# from a test asset dir, we're using golang
cf push golang -d is1.PROJECT_NAME.cf-app.com

# the following curl should succeed
curl golang.is1.PROJECT_NAME.cf-app.com
```

The following command should return a `404 Not Found`. This validates that an app in the isolation segment cannot be reached via the shared router.
```
curl -H "Host: golang.is1.PROJECT_NAME.cf-app.com" blah.PROJECT_NAME.cf-app.com
```
